        As a graphic designer, you will be responsible for creating graphics
        that represent our organization and events for various platforms, such
        as Facebook or Instagram. Designers also shape the theme and aesthetic
        for ZotHacks and IrvineHacks. Each design will follow general guidelines
        and have to be submitted for review before the given deadlines. You must
        be detail-oriented and have proficient knowledge of visual design, color
        theory, and typography. You will also be working closely with the web
        development team, so experience with HTML and CSS is a plus, but not
        required. Strong collaboration skills are also essential, as you will
        work with other members to contribute to club events.
